DID :


-2_ in the about page... changed the image to top and about-description below it... initially it was the description first and below it there is the image... i changed it...

-1_ used json to pass data from backend to the front end for the Vehicles cards page...

0_ make the model Vehicles... and create a superuser... register it in admin... add data to it...
0_1_0 make it for 3 categories of vehicles :
    1_LuxuryVehicles
    2_MeduimRange
    3_EconomyVehicles / cheap

0_1_1 Update the currency to rupees and also change the images to local images

1_ in the home page in "what our clients say" section make the feedback draggable/slidable and auto scrollable too...

2_ in the booking update the form to take the mobile number as +91 ,+1 and all other country codes... and also add a placeholder for the "startdate" and  "endDate" as some names that suit it...

3_ in the future updates input the data filled in that form for booking and instead make it only for logged in users only...and ask to login/signup before getting a vehicle... for the logged in users there is noo need to login just a single click is enough... but it would be better if the location to recieve the vehicle is inputted... but at the time of signup make the filled data directly store in the signup/registeration form... but make the directly filled data to change those by the user or leave them as usually...

4_ remove booking page directly from the home ... the booking page should be shown/redirected when a vehicle card is clicked ... i think its better to expand the vehicle details to a big redicting page with full of the vehicle details...

5_ make this footer a single button " Privacy Policy | Terms of Service" that redirects to the "about" page ... instead of 2 different buttons that redirects to same "about" page 

6_ im not sure but i think to remove the contact page from home navigator section and put it inside the about page...

7_ make the admin page that is used to upload Vehicles data able to have a cropping mechanism like an editor that users use to crop the uploaded Vehicle image to fit properly to that 80*80 shape and size... and also to be able to fetch the internet available images through url and also able to crop and shape them to 80*80 shape/size locally and store them locally...

8_ make our website international by accepting all country codes in the booking form through the list of all country codes script for javascript : https://www.cssscript.com/generic-country-state-dropdown-list-countries-js/



when uploading make the image to and also provide a cropping editor to select the portion of image by the admin with only this dimensions :
Width in px	1740
Height in px	1160
